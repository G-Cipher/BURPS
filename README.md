BeagleBone Universal Removed Pololu Steppers

BeagleBone Black cape providing a semi-generic optoisolated breakout for 4
stepper axis outputs and 3 limit swtich inputs. The BBB I/O pin configuration is
chosen for compatibility with [BeagleG][beagleg-url] for testing purposes. Output
is a male DB-25 connector, with pinout selected for compatibility with [FlashCut CNC]
[flashcut-url] stepper driver electronics.

BURPS is therefore a stripped-down implementation of [BUMPS][bumps-url], the
BeagleBone Universal Multi Pololu Steppers board.
